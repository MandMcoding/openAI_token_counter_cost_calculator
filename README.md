# openAI_token_counter_cost_calculator
I really like the pay as you go model of most LLMs' APIs, and so I made this simple script to calculate the input and output costs by counting the tokens and estimating the cost based on the model used. I needed it to count how much multiple files for inputs would cost so that is a big part of the functionality.
